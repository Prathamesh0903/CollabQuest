# Jump to Participant Functionality Demo

## Overview
The IntelliJ-style 'Jump to Participant' functionality has been successfully implemented in the BattlePlay component, providing instant navigation to any participant's cursor position in the Monaco Editor.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Participant List Component
- **Location**: Fixed position on the left side of the screen
- **Toggle**: Button in the header to show/hide the participant list
- **Real-time Updates**: Shows live cursor positions and participant status
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### 2. Jump to Participant Functionality
- **Instant Navigation**: Click "üéØ Jump" to instantly navigate to participant's cursor
- **Monaco Editor Integration**: Uses `editor.revealLineInCenter()` for smooth navigation
- **Cursor Positioning**: Sets editor cursor to the exact participant position
- **Activity Tracking**: Records jump actions in the activity feed

### 3. Enhanced Participant Information
- **Live Cursor Positions**: Shows current line and column for each participant
- **Status Indicators**: Visual indicators for active/inactive participants
- **Color Coding**: Each participant has a unique color for easy identification
- **Score Display**: Shows current battle scores and test results
- **Follow Integration**: Quick follow/unfollow buttons for each participant

### 4. Real-time Cursor Tracking
- **Socket Integration**: Uses existing socket infrastructure for real-time updates
- **Position Broadcasting**: Automatically shares cursor positions with all participants
- **Request System**: Can request current cursor positions from all participants
- **Efficient Updates**: Only updates when positions change significantly

## Usage

### Toggle Participant List
Click the "üë• Participants" button in the header to show/hide the participant list.

### Jump to Participant
1. Open the participant list
2. Find the participant you want to jump to
3. Click the "üéØ Jump" button next to their name
4. The editor will instantly navigate to their cursor position

### Follow Participants
1. Click the "üëÅÔ∏è Follow" button next to any participant
2. Your viewport will automatically sync with their movements
3. Click "üëÅÔ∏è Following" to stop following

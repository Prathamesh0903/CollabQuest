# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent potential exploitation.

### 2. Email us directly
Send an email to: [iamaman2901@gmail.com](mailto:iamaman2901@gmail.com)

### 3. Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if you have them)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### 4. What to expect:
- We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- We will provide regular updates on our progress
- We will work with you to resolve the issue
- We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Measures

### Code Execution Security
- All user code is executed in isolated Docker containers
- Resource limits are enforced (memory, CPU, time)
- Network access is restricted
- File system access is read-only
- Dangerous system calls are blocked

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with Supabase
- Role-based access control
- Session management with secure tokens
- OAuth integration with Google and Discord

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- XSS prevention measures in place
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

### Data Protection
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Secure database connections
- HTTPS enforcement in production

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper error handling

### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Use `npm audit fix` to fix known vulnerabilities
- Review dependency changes in pull requests

### Testing
- Include security tests in your test suite
- Test for common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.)
- Validate input sanitization
- Test authentication and authorization flows

## Security Checklist for Pull Requests

Before submitting a pull request, ensure:

- [ ] No secrets or API keys in code
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Authentication/authorization properly implemented
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security tests added (if applicable)
- [ ] Code follows security best practices

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Assess the severity and impact
2. **Containment**: Take steps to prevent further damage
3. **Investigation**: Determine the root cause and scope
4. **Communication**: Notify affected users and stakeholders
5. **Recovery**: Implement fixes and restore normal operations
6. **Post-Incident**: Conduct post-mortem and improve processes

## Security Tools

We use the following tools to maintain security:

- **npm audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **ESLint security plugin**: Code security linting
- **Helmet.js**: Security headers middleware
- **Rate limiting**: API abuse prevention
- **Input validation**: Request validation middleware

## Contact

- GitHub Security Advisory: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community and encourage responsible disclosure. Security researchers who follow our disclosure process will be acknowledged in our security advisories.

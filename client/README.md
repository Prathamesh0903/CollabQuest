### Pages and their components
- **DashboardPage**: wraps `components/Dashboard` and can show `DemoInstructions` or the in-app `CollaborativeEditor` when a session is active.
- **SessionEditorPage**: loads `CollaborativeEditor` bound to `:sessionId` route param.
- **AdvancedQuizPage**: renders `components/Quiz` with `isAdvanced` mode.

### Notes on editor refactor
- Extracted editor types/interfaces to `components/collab/types.ts`.
- Extracted `generateSessionId` to `components/collab/utils.ts`.
- `CollaborativeEditor.tsx` now imports these, reducing file size and improving readability.

## Using Timers with react-countdown

This project uses [react-countdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-countdown) for timer functionality (e.g., coding challenges, quiz timers, etc.).

### Installation

Already included in dependencies. If you need to reinstall:
```bash
npm install react-countdown
```

### Basic Usage Example

```tsx
import Countdown from 'react-countdown';

// 10-second countdown
<Countdown date={Date.now() + 10000} onComplete={() => alert('Time is up!')} />
```

You can use this in any component to add a timer.

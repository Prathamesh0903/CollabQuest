  options: {
    className: 'user-selection-highlight',
    hoverMessage: { value: `${displayName}'s selection` },
    glyphMarginClassName: 'user-selection-glyph',
    minimap: { color: userColor },
    overviewRuler: { color: userColor },
    stickiness: TrackedRangeStickiness.NeverGrowsWhenTypingAtEdges
  }
};
```
